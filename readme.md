<h3 align="center">A relatively bad PNG compressor written in Javascript</h3>

Up to 40% size reduction depending on how badly-optimized the original PNG is. (which shouldn't be the case)

Also works with JPEG but may give negative result.

Just don't use it, I wrote this for experimental purpose only.
